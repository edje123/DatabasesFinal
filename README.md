**Installation**

Before starting Contracer you will need to install it's dependecies. If you have NodeJS installed, you also have access to NPM and will be able to install dependecies by running
>npm install

in Contracer's home directory.

Contracer requires an installation of NodeJS in order to run. You can start Contracer by executing node in a command prompt and pointing it at Contracer's index.js file. NodeJS will need to be in your path file for this or you can execute Node through it's relative file location.

> node index.js

The express web server will run on port 3000. You can find it by opening localhost:3000 in a browser. If port 3000 is occupied you can modify the port that Contracer runs on in it's index file.

Once Contracer is up and running with all dependencies installed, there's nothing more that needs to be done. To stop Contracer, close the Node console that appears when Contracer is started.
